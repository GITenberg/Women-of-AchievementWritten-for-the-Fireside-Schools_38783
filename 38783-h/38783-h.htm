<h2>THE FIRESIDE SCHOOLS</h2>


<p>The work of the Fireside Schools was
begun in 1884 by Joanna P. Moore, who
was born in Clarion County, Pennsylvania,
September 26, 1832, and who died in Selma,
Alabama, April 15, 1916. For fifty years
Miss Moore was well known as an earnest
worker for the betterment of the Negro
people of the South. Beginning in the
course of the Civil War, at Island No. 10,
in November, 1863, she gave herself untiringly
to the work to which she felt called.
In 1864 she ministered to a group of people
at Helena, Arkansas. In 1868 she went to
Lauderdale, Mississippi, to help the Friends
in an orphan asylum. While she was at one
time left temporarily in charge of the institution
cholera broke out, and eleven children
died within one week; but she remained at
her post until the fury of the plague was
abated. She spent nine years in the vicinity
of New Orleans, reading the Bible to those
who could not read, writing letters in search
of lost ones, and especially caring for the
helpless old women that she met. In 1877
the Woman's American Baptist Home Mission
Society gave her its first commission.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>The object of the Fireside Schools is to
secure the daily prayerful study of God's
word by having this read to parents and
children together; to teach parents and children,
husbands and wives, their respective
duties one to another; to supply homes with
good reading matter; and also to inculcate
temperance, industry, neighborly helpfulness,
and greater attention to the work of
the church. The publication of <i>Hope</i>, the
organ of the Fireside Schools, was begun in
1885. Closely associated with the Schools
are the Bible Bands, a single band consisting
of any two or three people in the same
church or neighborhood who meet to review
the lessons in <i>Hope</i> and to report and plan
Christian work. All the activities are under
the general supervision of the Woman's
American Baptist Home Mission Society,
though the special Fireside School headquarters
are at 612 Gay Street, Nashville,
Tennessee. The present work is dedicated
to the memory of Joanna P. Moore, and to
the wives and mothers and sisters, now happily
numbered by the thousands, who are
engaged in the work of the Fireside Schools.</p>

<h2>I.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>INTRODUCTION.<br />

The Negro Woman in American Life</div>


<p>In the history of the Negro race in America
no more heroic work has been done than that
performed by the Negro woman. The great
responsibilities of life have naturally drifted
to the men; but who can measure the patience,
the love, the self-sacrifice of those
who in a more humble way have labored for
their people and even in the midst of war
striven most earnestly to keep the home-fires
burning? Even before emancipation a
strong character had made herself felt in
more than one community; and to-day,
whether in public life, social service, education,
missions, business, literature, music, or
even the professions and scholarship, the
Negro woman is making her way and reflecting
credit upon a race that for so many
years now has been struggling to the light.</p>

<p>It was but natural that those should first
become known who were interested in the
uplift of the race. If we except such an
unusual and specially gifted spirit as Phillis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Wheatley, we shall find that those who most
impressed the American public before the
Civil War were the ones who best identified
themselves with the general struggle for
freedom. Outstanding was the famous lecturer,
Sojourner Truth. This remarkable
woman was born of slave parents in the
state of New York about 1798. She recalled
vividly in her later years the cold, damp
cellar-room in which slept the slaves of the
family to which she belonged, and where she
was taught by her mother to repeat the
Lord's Prayer and to trust God at all times.
When in the course of the process of gradual
emancipation in New York she became legally
free in 1827, her master refused to
comply with the law. She left, but was
pursued and found. Rather than have her
go back, however, a friend paid for her
services for the rest of the year. Then there
came an evening when, searching for one of
her children that had been stolen and sold,
she found herself without a resting-place
for the night. A Quaker family, however,
gave her lodging. Afterwards she went to
New York City, joined a Methodist church,
and worked hard to improve her condition.
Later, having decided to leave New York
for a lecture tour through the East, she
made a small bundle of her belongings and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
informed a friend that her name was no
longer <i>Isabella</i>, as she had been known, but
<i>Sojourner</i>. Afterwards, as she herself said,
finding that she needed two names she
adopted <i>Truth</i>, because it was intended that
she should declare the truth to the people.
She went on her way, lecturing to people
wherever she found them assembled and being
entertained in many aristocratic homes.
She was entirely untaught in the schools,
but tall and of commanding presence, original,
witty, and always suggestive. The stories
told about her are numberless; but she
was ever moved by an abiding trust in God,
and she counted among her friends many of
the most distinguished Americans of her
time. By her tact and her gift of song she
kept down ridicule, and by her fervor and
faith she won many friends for the anti-slavery
cause.</p>

<p>It was impossible of course for any single
woman to carry on the tradition of such a
character as Sojourner Truth. She belonged
to a distinct epoch in the country's
history, one in which the rights of the Negro
and the rights of woman in general were
frequently discussed on the same platform;
and she passed&mdash;so far as her greatest influence
was concerned&mdash;with her epoch. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
more recent years those women who have
represented the race before the larger public
have been persons of more training and culture,
though it has been practically impossible
for any one to equal the native force
and wit of Sojourner Truth. Outstanding
in recent years have been Mrs. Booker T.
Washington and Mrs. Mary Church Terrell.
The spread of culture, however, and the
general force of the social emphasis have
more and more led those who were interested
in social betterment to come together
so that there might be the greater effect
from united effort. Thus we have had developing
in almost all of our cities and towns
various clubs working for the good of the
race, whether the immediate aim was literary
culture, an orphanage, an old folks' home,
the protection of working girls, or something
else similarly noble. Prominent among
the pioneers in such work were Mrs. Josephine
St. Pierre Ruffin, of Boston, and Mrs.
John T. Cook, of Washington, D. C. No
one can record exactly how much has been
accomplished by these organizations; in fact,
the clubs range all the way in effectiveness
from one that is a dominating force in its
town to one that is struggling to get started.
The result of the work, however, would in
any case sum up with an astonishing total.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
A report from Illinois, fairly representative
of the stronger work, mentioned the following
activities: "The Cairo hospital, fostered
and under the supervision of the Yates Club
of Cairo; the Anna Field Home for Girls,
Peoria; Lincoln Old Folks' and Orphans'
Home, founded by Mrs. Eva Monroe and
assisted by the Women's Club of Springfield;
the Home for Aged and Infirm Colored
People, Chicago, founded by Mrs.
Gabrella Smith and others; the Amanda
Smith Orphans' Home, Harvey; the Phillis
Wheatley Home for Wage-Earning Girls,
of Chicago." In Alabama the State Federation
of Colored Women's Clubs has established
and is supporting a reformatory at
Mt. Meigs for Negro boys, and the women
are very enthusiastic about the work. A
beautiful and well ordered home for Negro
girls was established a few years ago in
Virginia. Of the White Rose Mission of
New York we are told that it "has done
much good. A large number of needy ones
have found shelter within its doors and have
been able to secure work of all kinds. This
club has a committee to meet the incoming
steamers from the South and see that young
women entering the city as strangers are
directed to proper homes." All such work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
is touching in its tenderness and effectiveness.
The National Association of Colored
Women's Clubs was founded in 1896.
The organization has become stronger and
stronger until it is now a powerful and
effective one with hundreds of members.
One of its recent activities has been the purchase
of the home of Frederick Douglass at
Anacostia, D. C.</p>

<p>In education, church life, and missions&mdash;special
forms of social service&mdash;we have only
to look around us to see what the Negro
woman is accomplishing. Not only is she
bearing the brunt of common school education
for the race; in more than one instance
a strong character, moved to do something,
has started on a career of success a good
secondary or industrial school. Representative
are the Voorhees Normal and Industrial
School, at Denmark, S. C., founded by
Elizabeth C. Wright; the Daytona Normal
and Industrial Institute for Negro Girls,
founded by Mrs. M. M. Bethune; and the
Mt. Meigs Institute, Mt. Meigs, Alabama,
founded by Miss Cornelia Bowen. Noteworthy
for its special missionary emphasis
is the National Training School of Washington,
of which Miss Nannie H. Burroughs
is the head. One of the most important
recent developments in education has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the appointment of a number of young
women as supervisors in county schools
under the terms of the will of Anna T.
Jeanes, a Quaker lady of Philadelphia who
left a considerable sum of money for the
improvement of the rural schools of the
South. In church work we all know the
extent to which women have had to bear the
burden not only of the regular activities but
also of the numerous "rallies" that still so
unfortunately afflict our churches. Deserving
of special mention in connection with
social service is the work of those who have
labored under the auspices of the Young
Women's Christian Association, which has
done so much for the moral well-being of the
great camps in the war. In foreign mission
work one of the educational institutions sustained
primarily by Northern Baptist agencies&mdash;Spelman
Seminary&mdash;stands out with
distinct prominence. Not only has Spelman
sent to Africa several of her daughters from
this country, the first one being Nora Gordon
in 1889; she has also educated several
who have come to her from Africa, the first
being Lena Clark, and for these the hope
has ever been that they would return to their
own country for their largest and most
mature service.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>In the realm of business the Negro woman
has stood side by side with her husband in
the rise to higher things. In almost every
instance in which a man has prospered, investigation
will show that his advance was
very largely due to the faith, the patience,
and the untiring effort of his wife. Dr.
B. T. Washington, in his book <i>The Negro in
Business</i>, gave several examples. One of
the outstanding instances was in the story
of Junius G. Groves, famous potato grower
of Edwardsville, Kansas. This man moved
from his original home in Kentucky to
Kansas at the time of the well-known
"Exodus" of 1879, a migration movement
which was even more voluntary on the part
of the Negro than the recent removal to the
North on the part of so many, this latter
movement being in so many ways a result of
war conditions. Mr. Groves in course of
time became a man of large responsibilities
and means. It is most interesting, however,
to go back to his early days of struggle. We
read as follows: "Soon after getting the
crop planted Mr. Groves decided to marry.
When he reached this decision he had but
seventy-five cents in cash, and had to borrow
enough to satisfy the demands of the law.
But he knew well the worth and common
sense of the woman he was to marry. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
was as poor in worldly goods as himself; but
their poverty did not discourage them in
their plans. * * * * During the whole
season they worked with never-tiring energy,
early and late; with the result that when the
crop had been harvested and all debts paid
they had cleared $125. Notwithstanding
their lack of many necessaries of life, to say
nothing of comforts, they decided to invest
$50 of their earnings in a lot in Kansas City,
Kansas. They paid $25 for a milk cow, and
kept the remaining $50 to be used in the
making of another crop." In the course of
a few years Mr. Groves, with the help of
his wife, now the mother of a large family,
gathered in one year hundreds of thousands
of bushels of white potatoes, surpassing all
other growers in the world. Similarly was
the success of E. C. Berry, a hotel-keeper of
Athens, Ohio, due to his wife. "At night,
after his guests had fallen asleep, it was his
custom to go around and gather up their
clothes and take them to his wife, who would
add buttons which were lacking, repair rents,
and press the garments, after which Mr.
Berry would replace them in the guests'
rooms. Guests who had received such treatment
returned again and brought their
friends with them." In course of time Mr.
and Mrs. Berry came to own the leading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
hotel in Athens, one of fifty rooms and of
special favor with commercial travelers.</p>

<p>Such examples could be multiplied indefinitely.
It is not only in such spheres that
the worth of the Negro woman has been
shown, however. Daily, in thousands of
homes, in little stores and on humble farms,
effort just as heroic has been exerted,
though the result is not always so evident.
On their own initiative also women are now
engaging in large enterprises. The most
conspicuous example of material success is
undoubtedly Mme. C. J. Walker, of the
Mme. C. J. Walker Manufacturing Company,
of Indianapolis and New York, a
business that is now conducted on a large
scale and in accordance with the best business
methods of America. Important also
in this connection is the very great contribution
that Negro women&mdash;very often those
without education and opportunity&mdash;are
making in the ordinary industrial life of the
country. According to the census of 1910,
1,047,146, or 52 per cent. of those at work,
were either farmers or farm laborers, and
28 per cent. more were either cooks or washerwomen.
In other words, a total of exactly
80 per cent. were doing some of the
hardest and at the same time some of the
most necessary work in our home and industrial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
life. These are workers whose worth
has never been fully appreciated by the
larger public, and who needed the heavy
demands of the great war to call attention
to the actual value of the service they were
rendering.</p>

<p>The changes in fact brought about within
the last few years, largely as a result of war
conditions, are remarkable. As Mary E.
Jackson, writing in the <i>Crisis</i>, has said:
"Indiana reports [Negro women] in glass
works; in Ohio they are found on the night
shifts of glass works; they have gone into
the pottery works in Virginia; wood-working
plants and lumber yards have called for
their help in Tennessee." She also quotes
Rachel S. Gallagher, of Cleveland, Ohio, as
saying of the Negro women in that city:
"We find them on power sewing-machines,
making caps, waists, bags, and mops; we
find them doing pressing and various hand
operations in these same shops. They are
employed in knitting factories as winders,
in a number of laundries on mangles of
every type, and in sorting and marking.
They are in paper box factories doing both
hand and machine work, in button factories
on the button machines, in packing houses
packing meat, in railroad yards wiping and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
cleaning engines, and doing sorting in railroad
shops. One of our workers recently
found two colored girls on a knotting machine
in a bed spring factory, putting the
knots in the wire springs."</p>

<p>In the professions, such as medicine and
law, and in scholarship as well, the Negro
woman has blazed a path. One year after
Oberlin College in Ohio was founded in
1833, thirty years before the issuing of the
Emancipation Proclamation, the trustees
took the advanced ground of admitting
Negro men and women on equal terms with
other students. Of the Northern colleges
and universities Oberlin still leads in the
number of its Negro women graduates, but
in recent years other such institutions as
Radcliffe, Wellesley, Columbia, and Chicago
have been represented in an increasing
number by those who have finished their
work creditably and even with distinction in
many instances. More and more each year
are young women at these institutions going
forward to the attainment of the higher
scholastic degrees. In connection with medicine
we recall the work in the war of the
Negro woman in the related profession of
nursing. It was only after considerable discussion
that she was given a genuine opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
in Red Cross work, but she at once
vindicated herself. In the legal profession
she has not only been admitted to practice
in various places, but has also been appointed
to public office. It must be understood
that such positions as those just remarked
are not secured without a struggle,
but all told they indicate that the race
through its womanhood is more and more
taking part in the general life of the country.</p>

<p>In keeping with the romantic quality of
the race it was but natural that from the first
there should have been special effort at self-expression
in literature, music, and other
forms of art. The first Negro woman to
strike the public imagination was Phillis
Wheatley, who even as a young girl wrote
acceptable verse. Her <i>Poems on Various
Subjects</i> published in 1773 at once attracted
attention, and it was fitting that the
first Negro woman to become distinguished
in America should be one of outstanding
piety and nobility of soul. Just a few years
before the Civil War Frances Ellen Watkins,
better known as Mrs. F. E. W. Harper,
entered upon her career as a writer of
popular poetry. At the present time attention
centers especially upon Mrs. Georgia
Douglas Johnson, who early in 1918<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
produced in <i>The Heart of a Woman</i> a
little volume of delicate and poignantly
beautiful verse, and from whom greater and
greater things are expected, as she not only
has the temperament of an artist but has
also undergone a period of severe training
in her chosen field. In the wider field of
prose&mdash;including especially stories, essays,
and sketches&mdash;Mrs. Alice Moore Dunbar-Nelson
is prominent. In 1899 she produced
<i>The Goodness of St. Rocque, and
other stories</i>, and since then has continued
her good work in various ways. The whole
field of literature is a wide one, one naturally
appealing to many of the younger
women, and one that with all its difficulties
and lack of financial return does offer some
genuine reward to the candidate who is willing
to work hard and who does not seek a
short cut to fame.</p>

<p>In music the race has produced more
women of distinction than in any other field.
This was natural, for the Negro voice is
world famous. The pity is that all too frequently
some of the most capable young
women have not had the means to cultivate
their talents and hence have fallen by the
wayside. Some day it is to be hoped that a
great philanthropist will endow a real conservatory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
at which such persons may find
some genuine opportunity and encouragement
in their development in their days of
struggle. In spite of all the difficulties,
however, there have been singers who have
risen to very high things in their art. Even
before the Civil War the race produced one
of the first rank in Elizabeth Taylor Greenfield,
who came into prominence in 1851.
This artist, born in Mississippi, was taken
to Philadelphia and there cared for by a
Quaker lady. The young woman did not
soon reveal her gift to her friend, thinking
that it might be frowned upon as something
too worldly. Her guardian learned of it by
accident, however, and one day surprised her
by asking, "Elizabeth, is it true that thee can
sing?" "Yes," replied the young woman in
confusion. "Let me hear thee." And Elizabeth
sang; and her friend, realizing that she
had a voice of the first quality, proceeded to
give her the best instruction that it was possible
to get. Elizabeth Taylor Greenfield
had a marvelous voice embracing twenty-seven
notes, reaching from the sonorous bass
of a baritone to the highest soprano. A
voice with a range of more than three octaves
naturally attracted much attention in
both England and America, and comparisons
with Jenny Lind, then at the height of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
her great fame, were frequent. In the next
generation arose Madame Selika, a cultured
singer of the first rank, and one who by her
arias and operatic work generally, as well
as by her mastery of language, won great
success on the continent of Europe as well
as in England and America. The careers
of some later singers are so recent as to be
still fresh in the public memory; some in
fact may still be heard. It was in 1887 that
Flora Batson entered on the period of her
greatest success. She was a ballad singer
and her work at its best was of the sort that
sends an audience into the wildest enthusiasm.
In a series of temperance meetings in
New York she sang for ninety consecutive
nights, with never-failing effect, one song,
"Six Feet of Earth Make Us All One Size."
Her voice exhibited a compass of three octaves,
but even more important than its
range was its remarkable sympathetic quality.
Early in the last decade of the century
appeared also Mrs. Sissieretta Jones, whose
voice at once commanded attention as one of
unusual richness and volume, and as one
exhibiting especially the plaintive quality
ever present in the typical Negro voice.</p>

<p>At the present time there are several
promising singers; and there are also those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
who in various ways are working for the
general advancement of the race in music.
Mrs. E. Azalia Hackley, for some years
prominent as a concert soprano, has recently
given her time most largely to the work of
teaching and showing the capabilities of the
Negro voice. Possessed of a splendid
musical temperament, she has enjoyed the
benefit of three years of foreign study and
generally inspired many younger singers or
performers. Prominent among many excellent
pianists is Mrs. Hazel Harrison
Anderson, who also has studied much
abroad and who has appeared in many
noteworthy recitals. Mrs. Maud Cuney
Hare, of Boston, a concert pianist, has
within the last few years given several excellent
lecture-recitals dealing with Afro-American
music.</p>

<p>As between painting and sculpture the
women of the race have shown a decided
preference for sculpture. While there are
some students of promise, no woman has as
yet achieved distinction on work of really
professional quality in the realm of painting.
On the other hand there have been three or
four sculptors of genuine merit. As early
as 1865 Edmonia Lewis began to attract attention
by her busts of prominent people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Within the last few years the work of Mrs.
May Howard Jackson, of Washington, has
attracted the attention of the discerning;
and that of Mrs. Meta Warrick Fuller is
reserved for special comment.</p>

<p>Any such review as this naturally has its
limitations. We can indicate only a few of
the outstanding individuals here and there.
At least enough has been said, however, to
show that the Negro woman is making her
way at last into every phase of noble endeavor.
In the pages that follow we shall
attempt to set forth at somewhat greater
length the life and work of a few of those
whose achievement has been most signal and
whose interest in their sisters has been
unfailing.</p>

<p>Greatest of all the heroines of anti-slavery
was Harriet Tubman. This brave
woman not only escaped from bondage herself,
but afterwards made nineteen distinct
trips to the South, especially to Maryland,
and altogether aided more than three hundred
souls in escaping from their fetters.</p>

<p>Araminta Ross, better known by the
Christian name <i>Harriet</i> that she adopted,
and her married name of <i>Tubman</i>, was born
about 1821 in Dorchester County, on the
eastern shore of Maryland, the daughter of
Benjamin Ross and Harriet Greene, both
of whom were slaves, but who were privileged
to be able to live their lives in a state
of singular fidelity. Harriet had ten brothers
and sisters, not less than three of whom
she rescued from slavery; and in 1857, at
great risk to herself, she also took away to
the North her aged father and mother.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>
<p>When Harriet was not more than six
years old she was taken away from her
mother and sent ten miles away to learn the
trade of weaving. Among other things she
was set to the task of watching muskrat
traps, which work compelled her to wade
much in water. Once she was forced to
work when she was already ill with the
measles. She became very sick, and her
mother now persuaded her master to let the
girl come home for a while.</p>

<p>Soon after Harriet entered her teens she
suffered a misfortune that embarrassed her
all the rest of her life. She had been hired
out as a field hand. It was the fall of the
year and the slaves were busy at such tasks
as husking corn and cleaning up wheat.
One of them ran away. He was found. The
overseer swore that he should be whipped
and called on Harriet and some others that
happened to be near to help tie him. She
refused, and as the slave made his escape she
placed herself in a door to help to stop pursuit
of him. The overseer caught up a two-pound
weight and threw it at the fugitive;
but it missed its mark and struck Harriet a
blow on the head that was almost fatal. Her
skull was broken and from this resulted a
pressure on her brain which all her life left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
her subject to fits of somnolency. Sometimes
these would come upon her in the
midst of a conversation or any task at which
she might be engaged; then after a while
the spell would pass and she could go on as
before.</p>

<p>After Harriet recovered sufficiently from
her blow she lived for five or six years in
the home of one John Stewart, working at
first in the house but afterwards hiring her
time. She performed the most arduous
labor in order to get the fifty or sixty dollars
ordinarily exacted of a woman in her situation.
She drove oxen, plowed, cut wood,
and did many other such things. With her
firm belief in Providence, in her later years
she referred to this work as a blessing in
disguise as it gave her the firm constitution
necessary for the trials and hardships that
were before her. Sometimes she worked for
her father, who was a timber inspector and
superintended the cutting and hauling of
large quantities of timber for the Baltimore
ship-yards. Her regular task in this employment
was the cutting of half a cord of
wood a day.</p>

<p>About 1844 Harriet was married to a free
man named John Tubman. She had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
children. Two years after her escape in
1849 she traveled back to Maryland for her
husband, only to find him married to another
woman and no longer caring to live with
her. She felt the blow keenly, but did not
despair and more and more gave her
thought to what was to be the great work
of her life.</p>

<p>It was not long after her marriage that
Harriet began seriously to consider the matter
of escape from bondage. Already in
her mind her people were the Israelites in
the land of Egypt, and far off in the North
<i>somewhere</i> was the land of Canaan. In
1849 the master of her plantation died, and
word passed around that at any moment she
and two of her brothers were to be sold to
the far South. Harriet, now twenty-four
years old, resolved to put her long cherished
dreams into effect. She held a consultation
with her brothers and they decided to start
with her at once, that very night, for the
North. She could not go away, however,
without giving some intimation of her purpose
to the friends she was leaving behind.
As it was not advisable for slaves to be seen
too much talking together, she went among
her old associates singing as follows:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
When dat ar ol' chariot comes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'm gwine to leabe you;</span><br />

On de oder side of Jordan,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For I'm boun' for de Promised Land.</span><br />
</div>

<p>The brothers started with her; but the
way was unknown, the North was far
away, and they were constantly in terror
of recapture. They turned back, and Harriet,
after watching their retreating forms,
again fixed her eyes on the north star.
"I had reasoned dis out in my min'," said
she; "there was one of two things I had a
right to, liberty or death. If I could not
have one, I would have de other, for no man
should take me alive. I would fight for my
liberty as long as my strength lasted, and
when de time came for me to go, the Lord
would let them take me."</p>

<p>"And so without money, and without
friends," says Mrs. Bradford, "she started
on through unknown regions; walking by
night, hiding by day, but always conscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
of an invisible pillar of cloud by day, and of
fire by night, under the guidance of which
she journeyed or rested. Without knowing
whom to trust, or how near the pursuers
might be, she carefully felt her way, and by
her native cunning, or by God-given wisdom
she managed to apply to the right people for
food, and sometimes for shelter; though
often her bed was only the cold ground, and
her watchers the stars of night. After
many long and weary days of travel, she
found that she had passed the magic line
which then divided the land of bondage from
the land of freedom." At length she came to
Philadelphia, where she found work and the
opportunity to earn a little money. It was
at this time, in 1851, after she had been employed
for some months, that she went back
to Maryland for her husband only to find
that he had not been true.</p>

<p>In December, 1850, she had visited Baltimore
and brought away a sister and two
children. A few months afterwards she took
away a brother and two other men. In December,
1851, she led out a party of eleven,
among them being another brother and his
wife. With these she journeyed to Canada,
for the Fugitive Slave Law was now in
force and, as she quaintly said, there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
no safety except "under the paw of the
British Lion." The winter, however, was
hard on the poor fugitives, who unused to
the climate of Canada, had to chop wood in
the forests in the snow. Often they were
frost-bitten, hungry, and almost always
poorly clad. But Harriet was caring for
them. She kept house for her brother, and
the fugitives boarded with her. She begged
for them and prayed for them, and somehow
got them through the hard winter. In
the spring she returned to the States, as
usual working in hotels and families as a
cook. In 1852 she once more went to
Maryland, this time bringing away nine
fugitives.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that those who
started on the journey northward were
always strong-spirited characters. The
road was rough and attended by dangers
innumerable. Sometimes the fugitives grew
faint-hearted and wanted to turn back.
Then would come into play the pistol that
Harriet always carried with her. "Dead
niggers tell no tales," said she, pointing it
at them; "you go on or die!" By this heroic
method she forced many to go onward
and win the goal of freedom.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Unfailing was Harriet Tubman's confidence
in God. A customary form of prayer
for her was, "O Lord, you've been with me
in six troubles; be with me in the seventh."
On one of her journeys she came with a
party of fugitives to the home of a Negro
who had more than once assisted her and
whose house was one of the regular stations
on the so-called Underground Railroad.
Leaving her party a little distance away
Harriet went to the door and gave the peculiar
rap that was her regular signal. Not
meeting with a ready response, she knocked
several times. At length a window was
raised and a white man demanded roughly
what she wanted. When Harriet asked for
her friend she was informed that he had been
obliged to leave for assisting Negroes.
The situation was dangerous. Day was
breaking and something had to be done at
once. A prayer revealed to Harriet a place
of refuge. Outside of the town she remembered
that there was a little island in a
swamp, with much tall grass upon it.
Hither she conducted her party, carrying in
a basket two babies that had been drugged.
All were cold and hungry in the wet grass;
still Harriet prayed and waited for deliverance.
How relief came she never knew; she
felt that it was not necessarily her business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
to know. After they had waited through
the day, however, at dusk there came slowly
along the pathway on the edge of the
swamp a man clad in the garb of a Quaker.
He seemed to be talking to himself, but
Harriet's sharp ears caught the words: "My
wagon stands in the barnyard of the next
farm across the way. The horse is in the
stable; the harness hangs on a nail;" and
then the man was gone. When night came
Harriet stole forth to the place designated,
and found not only the wagon but also
abundant provisions in it, so that the whole
party was soon on its way rejoicing. In the
next town dwelt a Quaker whom Harriet
knew and who readily took charge of the
horse and wagon for her.</p>

<p>Naturally the work of such a woman
could not long escape the attention of the
abolitionists. She became known to Thomas
Garrett, the great-hearted Quaker of Wilmington,
who aided not less than three thousand
fugitives to escape, and also to Grit
Smith, Wendell Phillips, William H.
Seward, F. B. Sanborn, and many other
notable men interested in the emancipation
of the Negro. From time to time she was
supplied with money, but she never spent
this for her own use, setting it aside in case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
of need on the next one of her journeys.
In her earlier years, however, before she
became known, she gave of her own slender
means for the work.</p>

<p>Between 1852 and 1857 she made but one
or two journeys, because of the increasing
vigilance of slaveholders and the Fugitive
Slave Law. Great rewards were offered for
her capture and she was several times on the
point of being taken, but always escaped by
her shrewd wit and what she considered
warnings from heaven. While she was intensely
practical, she was also a most firm
believer in dreams. In 1857 she made her
most venturesome journey, this time taking
with her to the North her old parents who
were no longer able to walk such distances
as she was forced to go by night. Accordingly
she had to hire a wagon for them, and
it took all her ingenuity to get them through
Maryland and Delaware. At length, however,
she got them to Canada, where they
spent the winter. As the climate was too
rigorous, however, she afterwards brought
them down to New York, and settled them
in a home in Auburn, N. Y., that she had
purchased on very reasonable terms from
Secretary Seward. Somewhat later a mortgage
on the place had to be lifted and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Harriet now made a noteworthy visit to
Boston, returning with a handsome sum
toward the payment of her debt. At this
time she met John Brown more than once,
seems to have learned something of his
plans, and after the raid at Harper's Ferry
and the execution of Brown she glorified
him as a hero, her veneration even becoming
religious. Her last visit to Maryland was
made in December, 1860, and in spite of the
agitated condition of the country and the
great watchfulness of slaveholders she
brought away with her seven fugitives, one
of them an infant.</p>

<p>After the war Harriet Tubman made
Auburn her home, establishing there a refuge
for aged Negroes. She married again,
so that she is sometimes referred to as
Harriet Tubman Davis. She died at a very
advanced age March 10, 1913. On Friday,
June 12, 1914, a tablet in her honor was unveiled
at the Auditorium in Albany. It was
provided by the Cayuga County Historical
Association, Dr. Booker T. Washington
was the chief speaker of the occasion, and
the ceremonies were attended by a great
crowd of people.</p>

<p>The tributes to this heroic woman were
remarkable. Wendell Phillips said of her:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
"In my opinion there are few captains, perhaps
few colonels, who have done more for
the loyal cause since the war began, and few
men who did before that time more for the
colored race than our fearless and most sagacious
friend, Harriet." F. B. Sanborn
wrote that what she did "could scarcely be
credited on the best authority." William H.
Seward, who labored, though unsuccessfully,
to get a pension for her granted by
Congress, consistently praised her noble
spirit. Abraham Lincoln gave her ready
audience and lent a willing ear to whatever
she had to say. Frederick Douglass wrote
to her: "The difference between us is very
marked. Most that I have done and suffered
in the service of our cause has been in
public, and I have received much encouragement
at every step of the way. You, on the
other hand, have labored in a private way.
I have wrought in the day&mdash;you in the night.
I have had the applause of the crowd and the
satisfaction that comes of being approved by
the multitude, while the most that you have
done has been witnessed by a few trembling,
scarred, and footsore bondmen and women,
whom you have led out of the house of bondage,
and whose heartfelt 'God bless you' has
been your only reward."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Of such mould was Harriet Tubman,
philanthropist and patriot, bravest and noblest
of all the heroines of freedom.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<h2>III.</h2>

<p>NORA GORDON</p>


<p>This is the story of a young woman who
had not more than ordinary advantages, but
who in our own day by her love for Christ
and her zeal in his service was swept from
her heroic labor into martyrdom.</p>

<p>When Nora Gordon went from Spelman
Seminary as a missionary to the Congo, she
had the hope that in some little way she
might be used for the furtherance of the
Master's kingdom. She could hardly have
foreseen that she would start in her beloved
school a glorious tradition; and still less
could she have seen the marvellous changes
taking place in the Africa of the present.
She had boundless faith, however,&mdash;faith in
God and in the ultimate destiny of her people.
In that faith she lived, and for that
faith she died.</p>

<p>Nora Antonia Gordon was born in Columbus,
Georgia, August 25, 1866. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a><br /><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
receiving her early education in the public
schools of La Grange, in the fall of 1882 she
came to Spelman Seminary. It was not
long before her life became representative
of the transforming power of Christianity.
Being asked, "Do you love Christ?" she answered
"Yes"; but when there came the
question, "Are you a Christian?" she replied
"No." It was not long, however, before she
gained firmer faith, and two months after
her entrance at Spelman she was definitely
converted. Now followed seven years of
intense activity and growth&mdash;of study, of
summer teaching, of talks before temperance
societies, of service of any possible
sort for the Master. She brought to Christ
every girl who was placed to room with her.
A classmate afterwards testified of her that
the girls always regarded Nora somewhat
differently from the others. She was the
counsellor of her friends, ever ready with
sweet words of comfort, and yet ever a
cheerful companion. In one home in which
she lived for a while she asked the privilege
of having prayer. The man of the house at
first refused to kneel and the woman seemed
not interested. In course of time, however,
the wife was won and then the man also
knelt. At another time she wrote, "Twenty-six
of my scholars were baptized to-day;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and a little later she said, "Ten more have
been added."</p>

<p>In 1885 Nora Gordon completed her
course in the Industrial Department, in
1886 the Elementary Normal, and in 1888
the Higher Normal Course. Her graduation
essay was on the rather old and sophomoric
subject, "The Influence of Woman
on National Character;" but in the intensity
of her convictions and her words there was
nothing ordinary. She said in part: "Let
no woman feel that life to her means simply
living; but let her rather feel that she has a
special mission assigned her, which none
other of God's creatures can perform. It
may be that she is placed in some rude little
hut as mother and wife; if so, she can dignify
her position by turning every hut into
a palace, and bringing not only her own
household, but the whole community, into
the sunlight of God's love. Such women are
often unnoticed by the world in general, and
do not receive the appreciation due them;
yet we believe such may be called God's
chosen agents." Finally, "we feel that
woman is under a twofold obligation to consecrate
her whole being to Christ. Our people
are to be educated and christianized and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the heathen brought home to God. Woman
must take the lead in this great work."</p>

<p>After her graduation in 1888 Nora Gordon
was appointed to teach in the public
schools of Atlanta. She soon resigned this
work, however, in the contemplation of the
great mission of her life. The secretary of
the Society of the West wrote to Spelman
to inquire if there was any one who could go
to assist Miss Fleming, a missionary at work
in Palabala in the Congo. Four names were
sent, and the choice of the board was Nora
A. Gordon. The definite appointment
came in January, 1889. On Sunday evening,
February 17, an impressive missionary
service was held in the chapel at Spelman.
Interesting items were given by the students
with reference to the slave-trade in East
Africa and the efforts being made for its
suppression, also with reference to Mohammedanism,
the spiritual awakening among
the Zulus, and the mission stations established,
especially those on the Congo. Several
letters were read, one from Miss Fleming
exciting the most intense interest; and
throughout the meeting was the thought
that Nora Gordon was also soon to go to
Africa. On March 6 a farewell service was
held, and attended by a great crowd of people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
among them the whole family of the
consecrated young woman; and she sailed
March 16, 1889.</p>

<p>First of all she went to London, tarrying
at the Missionary Training Institute conducted
by Rev. and Mrs. H. Grattan Guinness.
Under date April 11 she wrote: "It
has been so trying to remain here so long
waiting. I feel that this is the dear Lord's
first lesson to me in patience. I am thankful
to say that I feel profited by my stay.
* * * * Yesterday coming from the
city we saw a number of flags hanging across
the street, and among them was the United
States flag. Never before did the Stars and
Stripes seem so beautiful. I am glad Miss
Grover put one in my box. * * * * I
do praise God for every step I get nearer
to my future home. We expect to sail next
Wednesday, April 17, from Rotterdam on
the steamer <i>African</i>, Dutch line. We hope
to get to the Congo in three weeks."</p>

<p>For two years she labored at Palabala,
frequently writing letters home and occasionally
sending back to her beloved Spelman
a box of curios. Said she of those
among whom she worked: "When the people
are first gathered into a chapel for school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
or religious services, it is sad and amusing
to see how hard they try to know just what
to do, a number sitting with their backs to
the preacher or teacher. When the teacher
reproves a child, every man, woman, and
child feels it his or her duty to yell out too
at the offender and tell him to obey the
teacher. Often in the midst of a sermon a
man in the congregation will call out to the
preacher, 'Take away your lies,' or 'We do
not believe you,' or 'How can this or that
be?' One of the first workers, after speaking
to a crowd of heathen, asked them all
to close their eyes and bow their heads while
he would pray to God. When the missionary
had finished his prayer and opened his
eyes, every person had stealthily left the
place." Then followed a detail of the atrocities
in the Congo and of the encounters between
the natives and the Belgian officers,
and last of all came the pertinent comment:
"The Congo missionary's work is twofold.
He must civilize, as well as Christianize, the
people."</p>

<p>Early in 1891 Nora Gordon, sadly in need
of rest and refreshment, went from Palabala
for a little stay at Lukungu. Hither
had come Clara A. Howard, Spelman's
second representative, under appointment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
of the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society
of the East. Lukungu is a station two
hundred and twenty miles from the mouth
of the Congo, in a populous district, and
was the center from which numerous other
schools and churches sprang. The work
was in charge of Mr. Hoste, an Englishman,
who, when Miss Gordon wrote of him
in 1894, had spent ten years on the Congo
without going home. Other men were associated
with him, while the elementary
schools, the care of the boys and girls, and
work among the women, naturally fell to
the women missionaries. A little later in
1891 Nora Gordon left Palabala permanently
to engage in the work at Lukungu.
Under date September 25 she wrote to her
friends back home: "Doubtless Clara has
told you of my change to this place. You
can not imagine how glad we are to be together
here. I have charge of the printing-office
and help in the afternoon school. I
am well, happy, and am enjoying my work.
In the office I have few conveniences and
really not the things we need. Mr. Hoste
has written the first arithmetic in this language
and I am now putting it up. I was
obliged to stop work on it to-day because
my figures in type gave out, and you know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
we have no shops in this land. My boys in
the office are doing nicely."</p>

<p>Thus she worked on for two years more&mdash;hoping,
praying, trusting. By 1893 her
health was in such condition that it was
deemed wise for her to return to America.
So she did, and she brought back two native
girls with her. All the while, however,
her chief thought was upon the work to
which she had given herself, and she constantly
looked forward to the time when she
might be able to go back to Africa. In 1895
she became the wife of Rev. S. C. Gordon,
who was connected with the English Baptist
Mission at Stanley Pool. She sailed
with her husband from Boston in July and
reached the Congo again in August. The
station was unique. It was an old and well
established mission, the center of several
others in the surrounding country. It had
excellent brick houses, broad avenues and
good fruit-trees, and the students were
above the average in intelligence. But soon
the shadow fell. Nora Gordon herself saw
much of the well known Belgian atrocities
in the Congo. She saw houses burned and
the natives themselves driven out by the
state officials. They crossed over into the
French Congo; but hither Protestants were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
not allowed to come to preach to them. In
spite of the great heartache, however, and
declining health the heroic woman worked
on, giving to those for whom she labored her
tenderest love. Seven months after the
death of her second child a change was again
deemed necessary, and she once more turned
her face homeward. After two months in
Belgium and England she came again to
America, and to Spelman. But her strength
was now all spent. She died at Spelman
January 26, 1901. She was only thirty-four;
but who can measure in years the love
and faith, the hope and sorrow, of such a
life?</p>

<p>Nora Gordon started a tradition, Spelman's
richest heritage. Three other graduates
followed her. Clara Howard was in
course of time forced by the severe fevers
to give up her work, and she now labors at
home in the service of her Alma Mater.
Ada Jackson became the second wife of
Rev. S. C. Gordon and also died in service.
Emma B. DeLany was commissioned in
1900 and still labors&mdash;in recent years with
larger and larger success&mdash;in Liberia. Within
two or three years of Nora Gordon's return
in 1893, moreover, not less than five native
African girls had come to Spelman. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
spirit still abides, and if the way were just
a little clearer doubtless many other graduates
would go. Even as it is, however, the
blessing to the school has been illimitable.</p>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such have been the workers, such the pioneers.
To what end is the love, the labor&mdash;the
loneliness, the yearning?</p>

<p>It is now nearly five hundred years since
a prince of Portugal began the slave-trade
on the west coast of Africa. Within two
hundred years all of the leading countries
of western Europe had joined in the iniquitous
traffic, and when England in 1713 drew
up with France the Peace of Utrecht she
deemed the slave-trade of such importance
that she insisted upon an article that gave
her a practical monopoly of it. Before the
end of the eighteenth century, however, the
voice of conscience began to be heard in
England, and science also began to be interested
in the great undeveloped continent
lying to the South. It remained for the
work of David Livingstone, however, in the
middle of the nineteenth century really to
reveal Africa to the rest of the world. This
intrepid explorer and missionary in a remarkable
series of journeys not only traversed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the continent from the extreme South
to Loanda on the West Coast and Quilimane
on the East Coast; he not only made
known the great lake system of Central
Africa; but he left behind him a memory
that has blessed everyone who has followed
in his steps. Largely as a result of his work
and that of his successor, Stanley, a great
congress met in Berlin in 1884 for the partition
of Africa among the great nations of
Europe. Unfortunately the diplomats at
this meeting were not actuated by the noble
impulses that had moved Livingstone, so
that more and more there was evident a mad
scramble for territory. France had already
gained a firm foothold in the northwest, and
England was not only firmly intrenched in
the South but had also established a rather
undefined protectorate over Egypt. Germany
now in 1884 entered the field and in
German East Africa, German Southwest
Africa, Kamerun, and the smaller territory
of Togoland in the West ultimately acquired
a total of nearly a million square
miles, or one-eleventh of the continent. All
of this she lost in the course of the recent
great war. Naturally she has desired to regain
this land, but at the time of writing
(November, 1918) there is no likelihood of
her doing so, a distinguished Englishman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Mr. Balfour, the foreign secretary, having
declared that under no circumstances can
Germany's African colonies be returned to
her, as such return would endanger the security
of the British empire, and that is to
say, the security of the world. This problem
is but typical of the larger political
questions that press for settlement in the
new Africa. Whatever the solution may be,
one or two facts stand out clearly. One is
that Africa can no longer rest in undisturbed
slumber. A terrible war, the most
ruinous in the history of humanity, has
strained to the utmost the resources of all
the great powers of the world. Where so
much has been spent it is not to be supposed
that the richest, the most fertile, land in
the world will indefinitely be allowed to remain
undeveloped. Along with material development
must go also the education and
the spiritual culture of the natives on a scale
undreamed of before. In this training such
an enlightened country as England will
naturally play a leading role, and America
too will doubtless be called on to help in
more ways than one. It must not be supposed,
however, that the task is not one of
enormous difficulties. As far as we have
advanced in our missionary activities in
America, we have hardly made a beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
in the great task of the proper development
of Africa. Here are approximately 175,000,000
natives to be trained and Christianized.
Let us not make the common mistake
of supposing that they are all ignorant
and degraded savages. Nothing could be
farther from the truth. Many individuals
have had the benefit of travel and study in
Europe and more and more are themselves
appreciating the great problems before their
country. It is true, however, that the great
mass of the population is yet to be reached.
In the general development delicate questions
of racial contact are to be answered.
Unfortunately, in the attitude of the European
colonist toward the native, South
Africa has a race problem even more stern
than that of our own Southern states. As
for religion we not only find paganism and
Mohammedanism, but we also see Catholicism
arrayed against Protestantism, and
perhaps most interesting of all, a definite
movement toward the enhancement of a
native Ethiopian church, with the motto
"Africa for the Africans." Let us add to
all this numerous social problems, such as
polygamy, the widespread sale of rum, and
all the train of African superstition, and we
shall see that any one who works in Africa in
the new day must not only be a person of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
keen intelligence and Christian character,
but also one with some genuine vision and
statesmanship. Workers of this quality, if
they can be found, will be needed not by the
scores or hundreds, but by the thousands and
tens of thousands. No larger mission could
come to a young Negro in America trained
in Christian study than to make his or her
life a part of the redemption of the great
fatherland. The salvation of Africa is at
once the most pressing problem before either
the Negro race or the Kingdom of Christ.
Such a worker as we have tried to portray
was Nora Gordon. It is to be hoped that
not one but thousands like her will arise.
Even now we can see the beginning of the
fulfilment of the prophecy, "Princes shall
come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon
stretch out her hands unto God."</p>

<p>The state of Massachusetts has always
been famous for its history and literature,
and especially rich in tradition is the region
around Boston. On one side is Charlestown,
visited yearly by thousands who make
a pilgrimage to the Bunker Hill Monument.
Across the Charles River is Cambridge, the
home of Harvard University, and Longfellow,
and Lowell, and numerous other
men whose work has become a part of the
nation's heritage. If one will ride on through
Cambridge and North Cambridge and Arlington,
he will come to Lexington, where
he will find in the little Lexington Common
one of the most charming spots of ground
in America. Overlooking this he will see
the Harrington House, and all around other
memorials of the Revolution. Taking the
car again and riding about seven miles more
he will come to Concord, and here he will
catch still more of the flavor of the eighteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
century. Walking from the center of
the town down Monument Street (he <i>must</i>
walk now; there is no trolley, and a carriage
or automobile does not permit one to linger
by the wayside), he will come after a while
to the Old Manse, once the home of Emerson
and of Hawthorne, and then see just around
the corner the Concord Bridge and the
statue of the Minute Man. There is a new
bridge now, one of concrete; the old wooden
one, so long beloved, at length became unsafe
and had to be replaced. In another
direction from the center of the town runs
Lexington Road, within about half a mile
down which one will see the later homes of
Emerson and Hawthorne as well as that
of Louisa May Alcott. Near the Alcott
House, back among the trees, is a quaint
little structure much like a Southern country
schoolhouse&mdash;the so-called Concord
School of Philosophy, in which Emerson
once spoke. It is all a beautiful country&mdash;beautiful
most of all for its unseen glory.
One gives himself up to reflection; he muses
on Evangeline and the Great Stone Face
and on the heroic dead who did not die in
vain&mdash;until a lumbering truck-car on the
road calls him back from it all to the workaday
world of men.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>
<p>It is in this state of Massachusetts, so
rich in its tradition, that there resides the
subject of the present sketch. About halfway
between Boston and Worcester, in the
quiet, homelike town of Framingham, on a
winding road just off the main street, lives
Meta Warrick Fuller, the foremost sculptor
of the Negro race.</p>

<p>There are three little boys in the family.
They keep their mother very busy; but they
also make her very happy. Buttons have
to be sewed on and dinners have to be prepared
for the children of an artist just as
well as for those of other people; and help
is not always easy to get. But the father,
Dr. S. C. Fuller, a distinguished physician,
is also interested in the boys, so that he too
helps, and the home is a happy one.</p>

<p>At the top of the house is a long roomy
attic. This is an improvised studio&mdash;or, as
the sculptor would doubtless say, the workshop.
Hither, from the busy work of the
morning, comes the artist for an hour or
half an hour of modeling&mdash;for rest, and for
the first effort to transfer to the plastic clay
some fleeting transient dream.</p>

<p>Meta Warrick Fuller was born in Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania, June 9, 1877. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
four years she attended the Pennsylvania
School of Industrial Art, and it was at this
institution that she first began to force serious
recognition of her talent. Before very
long she began to be known as a sculptor
of the horrible, one of her first original
pieces being a head of Medusa, with a hanging
jaw, beads of gore, and eyes starting
from their sockets. At her graduation in
1898 she won a prize for metal work by a
crucifix upon which hung the figure of
Christ in agony, and she also won honorable
mention for her work in modeling. In a
post-graduate year she won a much coveted
prize in modeling. In 1899 Meta Warrick
(then best known by her full name, Meta
Vaux Warrick) went to Paris, where she
worked and studied three years. Her work
brought her in contact with many other artists,
among them Augustus St. Gaudens,
the sculptor of the Robert Gould Shaw
Monument at the head of Boston Common.
Then there came a day when by appointment
the young woman went to see Auguste
Rodin, who after years of struggle and dispraise
had finally won recognition as the
foremost sculptor in France if not in the
world. The great man glanced one after
another at the pieces that were presented to
him, without very evident interest. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
length, thrilled by the figure in "Silent
Sorrow," sometimes referred to as "Man
Eating His Heart Out," Rodin beamed
upon the young woman and said, "Mademoiselle,
you <i>are</i> a sculptor; you have the
sense of form." With encouragement from
such a source the young artist worked with
renewed vigor, looking forward to the time
when something that she had produced
should win a place in the Salon, the great
national gallery in Paris. "The Wretched,"
one of the artist's masterpieces, was exhibited
here in 1903, and along with it went
"The Impenitent Thief." This latter production
was demolished in 1904, after meeting
with various unhappy accidents. In the
form as presented, however, the thief, heroic
in size, hung on the cross torn by anguish.
Hardened, unsympathetic, and even
defiant, he still possessed some admirable
qualities of strength, and he has remained
one of the sculptor's most powerful conceptions.
In "The Wretched" seven figures
greet the eye. Each represents a different
form of human anguish. An old man, worn
by hunger and disease, waits for death. A
mother yearns for the loved ones she has
lost. A man bowed by shame fears to look
upon his fellow-creatures. A sick child
suffers from some hereditary taint. A youth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
is in despair, and a woman is crazed by sorrow.
Over all is the Philosopher who suffers
perhaps more keenly than the others as he
views the misery around them, and who,
powerless to relieve it, also sinks into despair.</p>

<p>Other early productions were similarly
characterized by a strongly romantic quality.
"Silent Sorrow" has already been remarked
in passing. In this a man, worn and
gaunt and in despair, is represented as leaning
over and actually eating out his own
heart. "Man Carrying Dead Body" is in
similar vein. The sculptor is moved by the
thought of one who will be spurred on by
the impulse of duty to the performance of
some task not only unpleasant but even
loathsome. She shows a man bearing across
his shoulder the body of a comrade that has
evidently lain on the battlefield for days.
The thing is horrible, and the man totters
under the great weight; but he forces his
way onward until he can give it decent
burial. Another early production was
based on the ancient Greek story of Oedipus.
This story was somewhat as follows:
Oedipus was the son of Laius and Jocasta,
king and queen of Thebes. At his birth an
oracle foretold that the father Laius would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
be killed by his son. The child was sent
away to be killed by exposure, but in course
of time was saved and afterwards adopted
by the King of Corinth. When he was
grown, being warned by an oracle that he
would kill his father and marry his mother,
he left home. On his journey he met Laius
and slew him in the course of an altercation.
Later, by solving the riddle of the sphinx,
he freed Thebes from distress, was made
king of the city, and married Jocasta.
Eventually the terrible truth of the relationship
became known to all. Jocasta
hanged herself and Oedipus tore out his
eyes. The sculptor portrays the hero of the
old legend at the very moment that he is thus
trying to punish himself for his crime.
There is nothing delicate or pretty about all
such work as this. It is grewsome in fact,
and horrible; but it is also strong and intense
and vital. Its merit was at once recognized
by the French, and it gave Meta
Warrick a recognized place among the
sculptors of America.</p>

<p>On her return to America the artist resumed
her studies at the School of Industrial
Art, winning in 1904 the Battles first
prize for pottery. In 1907 she produced a
series of tableaux representing the advance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
of the Negro for the Jamestown Tercentennial
Exposition, and in 1913 a group for the
New York State Emancipation Proclamation
Commission. In 1909 she became the
wife of Dr. Solomon C. Fuller, of Framingham,
Massachusetts. A fire in 1910 unfortunately
destroyed some of her most
valuable pieces while they were in storage
in Philadelphia. Only a few examples of
her early work, that happened to be elsewhere,
were saved. The artist was undaunted,
however, and by May, 1914, she
had sufficiently recovered from the blow to
be able to hold at her home a public exhibition
of her work.</p>

<p>After this fire a new note crept into the
work of Meta Warrick Fuller. This was
doubtless due not so much to the fire itself
as to the larger conception of life that now
came to the sculptor with the new duties of
marriage and motherhood. From this time
forth it was not so much the romantic as the
social note that was emphasized. Representative
of the new influence was the second
model of the group for the Emancipation
Proclamation Commission. A recently
emancipated Negro youth and maiden stand
beneath a gnarled, decapitated tree that has
what looks almost like a human hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
stretched over them. Humanity is pushing
them forth into the world while at the same
time the hand of Destiny is restraining them
in the full exercise of their freedom. "Immigrant
in America" is in somewhat similar
vein. An American woman, the mother of
one strong healthy child, is shown welcoming
to the land of plenty the foreigner, the
mother of several poorly nourished children.
Closely related in subject is the smaller
piece, "The Silent Appeal," in which a
mother capable of producing and caring for
three sturdy children is shown as making a
quiet demand for the suffrage and for any
other privileges to which a human being is
entitled. All of these productions are clear
cut, straightforward, and dignified.</p>

<p>In May, 1917, Meta Warrick Fuller took
second prize in a competition under the
auspices of the Massachusetts Branch of the
Woman's Peace Party, her subject being
"Peace Halting the Ruthlessness of War."
War is personified as on a mighty steed and
trampling to death numberless human beings.
In one hand he holds a spear on which
he has transfixed the head of one of his victims.
As he goes on his masterful career
Peace meets him and commands him to cease
his ravages. The work as exhibited was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
gray-green wax and was a production of
most unusual spirit.</p>

<p>Among other prominent titles are "Watching
for Dawn," a conception of remarkable
beauty and yearning, and "Mother and
Child." An early production somewhat detached
from other pieces is a head of John
the Baptist. This is one of the most haunting
creations of Mrs. Fuller. In it she was
especially successful in the infinite yearning
and pathos that she somehow managed to
give to the eyes of the seer. It bears the
unmistakable stamp of power.</p>

<p>In this whole review of this sculptor's
work we have indicated only the chief
titles. She is an indefatigable worker and
has produced numerous smaller pieces,
many of these being naturally for commercial
purposes. As has been remarked, while
her work was at first romantic and often
even horrible, in recent years she has been
interested rather in social themes. There
are those, however, who hope that she will
not utterly forsake the field in which she
first became distinguished. Through the
sternness of her early work speaks the very
tragedy of the Negro race. In any case it
is pleasant to record that the foremost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
sculptor of the race is not only an artist of
rank but also a woman who knows and appreciates
in the highest possible manner the
virtues and the beauties of the home.</p>

<p>On October 3, 1904, a lone woman, inspired
by the desire to do something for the
needy ones of her race and state, began at
Daytona, Florida, a training school for
Negro girls. She had only one dollar and
a half in money, but she had faith, energy,
and a heart full of love for her people. To-day
she has an institution worth not less
than one hundred thousand dollars, with
plans for extensive and immediate enlargement,
and her school is one of the best conducted
and most clear-visioned in the country.
Such has been the result of boundless
energy and thrift joined to an unwavering
faith in God.</p>

<p>Mary McLeod was born July 10, 1875, in
a three-room log cabin on a little cotton and
rice farm about three miles from Mayesville,
South Carolina, being one in the large
family of Samuel and Patsy McLeod. Ambitious
even from her early years, she
yearned for larger and finer things than her
environment afforded; and yet even the life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
that she saw around her was to prove a
blessing in disguise, as it gave to her deeper
and clearer insight into the problems, the
shortcomings, and the needs of her people.
In course of time she attended a little mission
school in Mayesville, and she was converted
at the age of twelve. Later she was
graduated at Scotia Seminary, Concord,
North Carolina, and then she went to the
Moody Bible Institute in Chicago. In the
years of her schooling she received some assistance
from a scholarship given by Miss
Mary Chrisman, a dressmaker of Denver,
Colorado. Mary McLeod never forgot that
she had been helped by a working woman.
Some day she intended to justify that faith,
and time has shown that never was a scholarship
invested to better advantage.</p>

<p>In 1898 Mary McLeod was married. She
became the mother of one son. Not long
after, the family moved to Palatka, Florida.
Now followed the hard years of waiting, of
praying, of hoping; but through it all the
earnest woman never lost faith in herself,
nor in God. She gained experience in a
little school that she taught, she sang with
unusual effect in the churches of the town,
and she took part in any forward movement
or uplift enterprise that she could. All the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
while, however, she knew that the big task
was yet to come. She prayed, and hoped,
and waited.</p>

<p>By the fall of 1904 it seemed that the time
had come. In a little rented house, with five
girls, Mrs. Bethune began what is now the
Daytona Normal and Industrial Institute
for Negro Girls. By means of concerts and
festivals the first payment of five dollars was
made on the present site, then an old dump-pile.
With their own hands the teacher and
the pupils cleared away much of the rubbish,
and from the first they invited the co-operation
of the people around them by lending a
helping hand in any way they could, by
"being neighborly." In 1905 a Board of
Trustees was organized and the school was
chartered. In 1907 Faith Hall, a four-story
frame house, forty by fifty feet, was "prayed
up, sung up, and talked up;" and we can
understand at what a premium space was in
the earlier days when we know that this
building furnished dormitory accommodations
for teachers and students, dining-room,
reading room, storerooms, and bathrooms.
To the rear of Faith Hall was placed a two-story
structure containing the school kitchen
and the domestic science room. In 1909 the
school found it necessary to acquire a farm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
for the raising of live stock and vegetables
and for the practical outdoor training of the
girls. After six weeks of earnest work the
twelve-acre tract in front of the school was
purchased. In 1914 a Model Home was
built. In this year also an additional west
farm of six acres, on which was a two-story
frame building, was needed, asked for and
procured. In March, 1918, the labors of
fourteen years were crowned by the erection
and dedication of a spacious auditorium;
and among the speakers at the dedication
were the Governor of Florida and the Vice-President
of the United States. Efforts now
look forward to a great new dormitory for
the girls.</p>

<p>Such a bare account of achievements,
however, by no means gives one an adequate
conception of the striving and the hopings
and the praying that have entered into the
work. To begin with, Daytona was a strategic
place for the school. There was no other
such school along the entire east coast of
Florida, and as a place of unusual beauty
and attractiveness the town was visited
throughout the winter by wealthy tourists.
From the very first, however, the girls were
trained in the virtues of the home, and in
self-help. Great emphasis was placed on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
domestic science, and not only for this as an
end in itself, but also as a means for the
larger training in cleanliness and thrift and
good taste. "We notice strawberries are
selling at fifty and sixty cents a quart," said
a visitor, "and you have a splendid patch.
Do you use them for your students or sell
them?" "We never eat a quart when we
can get fifty cents for them," was the reply.
"We can take fifty cents and buy a bone that
will make soup for us all, when a quart of
berries would supply only a few."</p>

<p>For one interested in education few pictures
could be more beautiful than that of
the dining-room at the school in the morning
of a day in midterm. Florida is warm often
even in midwinter; nevertheless, rising at
five gives one a keen appetite for the early
breakfast. The ceiling is low and there are
other obvious disadvantages; but over all is
the spirit of good cheer and of home. The
tablecloths are very white and clean; flowers
are on the different tables; at the head of
each a teacher presides over five or six girls;
the food is nourishing and well-prepared;
and one leaves with the feeling that if he had
a sister or daughter he would like for her to
have the training of some such place as this.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Of such quality is the work that has been
built up; and all has been accomplished
through the remarkable personality of the
woman who is the head and the soul of every
effort. Indomitable courage, boundless energy,
fine tact and a sense of the fitness of
things, kindly spirit, and firm faith in God
have deservedly given her success. Beyond
the bounds of her immediate institution her
influence extends. About the year 1912 the
trustees felt the need of so extending the
work as to make the school something of a
community center; and thus arose the McLeod
Hospital and Training School for
Nurses. In 1912, moved by the utter neglect
of the children of the turpentine camp
at Tomoka, Mrs. Bethune started work for
them in a little house that she secured. The
aim was to teach the children to be clean and
truthful and helpful, to sew and to sweep
and to sing. A short school term was
started among them, and the mission serves
as an excellent practice school for the girls
of the senior class in the Training School.
A summer school and a playground have
also been started for the children in Daytona.
Nor have the boys and young men
been neglected. Here was a problem of
unusual difficulty. Any one who has looked
into the inner life of the small towns of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Florida could not fail to be impressed by the
situation of the boys and young men. Hotel
life, a shifting tourist population, and a climate
of unusual seductiveness, have all left
their impress. On every side to the young
man beckons temptation, and in town after
town one finds not one decent recreation
center or uplifting social influence. Pool-rooms
abound, and the young man is blamed
for entering forbidden paths; but all too
often the Christian men and women of the
community have put forth no definite organized
effort for his uplift. All too often
there results a blasted life&mdash;a heartache for
a mother, or a ruined home for some young
woman. In Daytona, in 1913, on a lot near
the school campus, one of the trustees, Mr.
George S. Doane, erected a neat, commodious
building to be used in connection with
the extension work of the institution as a
general reading-room and home for the
Young Men's Christian Association; and
this is the only specific work so being done
for Negro boys in this section of the state.
A debating club, an athletic club, lecture
club, and prayer-meetings all serve as means
toward the physical, intellectual, and spiritual
development of the young men. A
"Better Boys Movement" is also making
progress and the younger boys are becoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
interested in canning and farming as
well as being cared for in their sports and
games.</p>

<p>No sketch of this woman's work should
close without mention of her activities for
the nation at large. Red Cross work or a
Liberty Loan drive has alike called forth her
interest and her energy. She has appeared
on some great occasions and before distinguished
audiences, such as that for instance
in the Belasco Theatre in Washington in
December, 1917, when on a noteworthy patriotic
occasion she was the only representative
of her race to speak.</p>

<p>Her girls have gone into many spheres of
life and have regularly made themselves
useful and desirable. Nearly two hundred
are now annually enrolled at the school.
The demand for them as teachers, seamstresses,
or cooks far exceeds the supply. In
great homes and humble, in country or in
town, in Daytona or elsewhere&mdash;North,
South, East, West&mdash;they remember the
motto of their teacher and of the Master of
all, "Not to be ministered unto but to minister;"
and year after year they accomplish
better and better things for the school that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
they love so well and through it for the
Kingdom of God.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Two thousand years ago the Savior of
Mankind walked upon the earth, a man of
sorrows and acquainted with grief; and the
people hid as it were their faces from him.
But one day he went into the home of a
Pharisee and sat him down to meat. And a
woman of the city, when she knew that
Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house,
brought an alabaster box of ointment, exceeding
precious, and began to wash his feet
with her tears, and did wipe them with the
hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and
anointed them with the ointment. And there
were some that had indignation among themselves,
and said, Why was this waste of the
ointment made? But Jesus said, Let her
alone. She hath wrought a good work on
me. She hath done what she could. Verily,
I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel
shall be preached throughout the whole
world, this also that she hath done shall be
spoken of for a memorial of her.</p>

<p>To-day as well as centuries ago the Christ
is before us, around us, waiting. We do not
always know him, for he appears in disguise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
as a little orphan, or a sick old woman,
or even perhaps as some one of high estate
but in need of prayer. Let us do what we
can. Let each one prove herself an earnest
follower. To such end is the effort of Mary
McLeod Bethune; and as we think of all
that she has done and is doing let us for our
own selves once more recall the beautiful
words of Sister Moore: "There is no place
too lowly or dark for our feet to enter, and
no place so high and bright but it needs the
touch of the light that we carry from the
Cross."</p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>MARY CHURCH TERRELL</div>


<p>With the increasingly complex problems
of American civilization, woman is being
called on in ways before undreamed of to
bear a share in great public burdens. The
recent great war has demonstrated anew
the part that she is to play in our factories,
our relief work, our religious organizations&mdash;in
all the activities of our social and industrial
life. The broadening basis of the suffrage
in some states and the election of a
woman to a seat in Congress have also emphasized
the fact that in the new day woman
as well as man will have to bear the larger
responsibilities of citizenship. In all this
intense life the Negro woman has taken a
part, and she will have to do still more in the
future. Even before the Civil War there
were women of the race who labored, sometimes
in large ways, for the influencing of
sentiment and the salvation of their people.
In the present period of our country's history
new problems arise, sometimes even
more delicate than those that went before
them and even more difficult of solution&mdash;problems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
of education, readjustment, and of
the proper moulding of public opinion.
They call for keen intelligence, broad information,
rich culture, and the ability to meet
men and women of other races and other
countries on the broad plane of cosmopolitanism.
In public life and in the higher
graces of society no woman of the race has
commanded more attention from the American
and the international public than Mary
Church Terrell.</p>

<p>The life of this woman is an example of
the possibilities not only of Negro but of
American womanhood. She has appeared
on platforms with men and women of other
races, sometimes sturdy opponents on public
questions, and more than held her own.
She has attended an international congress
in Europe and surpassed all the other
women from her country in her ability to
address audiences in languages other than
English. With all this she has never forgotten
the religious impulse that is so
strong in the heart of her people and that
ultimately is to play so large a part in their
advancement. One admirer of her culture
has said, "She should be engaged to travel
over the country as a model of good manners
and good English."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Mary Church was born in Memphis,
Tennessee, the daughter of Robert R. and
Louisa Ayres Church. When she was yet
very young her parents sent her to Ohio to
be educated, and here she remained until
she was graduated from the classical course
in 1884. Then for two years she taught at
Wilberforce University in Ohio, and for one
year more in a high school in Washington.
Desirous of broadening her attainments,
however, she now went to Europe for a
period of study and travel. She remained
two years, spending the time in France,
Switzerland, Germany, and Italy, generally
improving herself in language. On her return
she resumed her work in Washington,
and she was offered the registrarship at
Oberlin College, a distinct compliment coming
as it did from an institution of such high
standing. She declined the attractive position,
however, because of her approaching
marriage to Robert H. Terrell, a graduate
of Harvard College and formerly principal
of a high school in Washington, who was
appointed to a judgeship in the District of
Columbia by President Roosevelt.</p>

<p>Since her marriage Mrs. Terrell has written
much on topics of general interest and
from time to time has formally appeared as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
a public lecturer. One of her strongest articles
was that on Lynching in the <i>North
American Review</i> for June, 1904. The centenary
of the birth of Harriet Beecher
Stowe in 1912 found her unusually well
posted on the life and work of the novelist,
so that after she lectured many times on the
subject she brought together the results of
her study in an excellent pamphlet. She
was the first president of the National Association
of Colored Women's Clubs, was
twice re-elected, and, declining to serve further,
was made honorary president for life.
She was chosen as one of the speakers at the
International Congress of Women held in
Berlin in June, 1904. Said the <i>Washington
Post</i> of her performance on this occasion:
"The hit of the Congress on the part of the
American delegates was made by Mrs.
Mary Church Terrell of Washington, who
delivered one speech in German and another
in equally good French. Mrs. Terrell is a
colored woman who appears to have been
beyond every other of our delegates prominent
for her ability to make addresses in
other than her own language." In a letter
to some of the largest newspapers in the
country Mrs. Ida Husted Harper said further:
"This achievement on the part of a
colored woman, added to a fine appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
and the eloquence of her words, carried the
audience by storm and she had to respond
three times to the encores before they were
satisfied. It was more than a personal triumph;
it was a triumph for her race."</p>

<p>Mrs. Terrell has ever exhibited an intense
interest in public affairs. On the occasion
of the discharge of the Negro soldiers
in Brownsville, Texas, in 1906, she at once
comprehended the tremendous issues involved
and by her interviews with men high
in the nation's life did much for the improvement
of a bad situation. When, some
years ago, Congress by resolution granted
power to the Commissioners of the District
of Columbia to appoint two women upon the
Board of Education for the public schools,
Mrs. Terrell was one of the women appointed.
She served on the Board for five
years with signal ability and unusual success,
and on the occasion of her resignation
in 1912 was given a magnificent testimonial
by her fellow-citizens.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to record all the different
things that Mary Church Terrell has
done or the numerous ways in which she has
turned sentiment on the race problem. In
recent years she has been drawn more and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
more to her own home. She is in constant
demand as a speaker, however, and one or
two experiences or incidents must not pass
unremarked. In 1906 she was invited by
Prof. Jeremiah W. Jenks to come to Cornell
University to deliver her address on the
Bright Side of the Race Problem. She was
introduced by Prof. F. A. Fetter of the Department
of Economics. When she had finished
her lecture she was greeted by deafening
applause, and then she was surrounded
by an eager crowd desirous of receiving an
introduction. One enthusiastic woman exclaimed,
as she warmly shook the speaker's
hand, "I was so glad to hear you say something
about the bright side, and&mdash;do you
know?&mdash;every Southern faculty woman was
here." A little later she was the guest of
honor at a reception in the home of Ex-Ambassador
Andrew D. White, the first
president of Cornell University.</p>

<p>Just what Mary Church Terrell means as
an inspiration to the young women of the
Negro race one might have seen some years
ago if he could have been present at Spelman
Seminary on the occasion of the twenty-fifth
anniversary of this the largest school for
Negro girls in the world. She was preceded
on the program by one or two prominent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
speakers who tried to take a broad view of
the race problem but who were plainly baffled
when they came face to face with Southern
prejudice. When Mrs. Terrell rose to
speak the air was tense with eagerness and
anxiety. How she acquitted herself on this
occasion, how eloquently she plead, and how
nimbly and delicately she met her opponents'
arguments, will never be forgotten by
any one who was privileged to hear her.</p>

<p>The compliments that have been paid to
the eloquence, the grace, the culture, the
tact, and the poise of this woman are endless.
She exhibits exceptional attainments
either on or off the platform. Her words
bristle with earnestness and energy, quickly
captivating an audience or holding the
closest attention in conversation. Her gestures
are frequent, but always in sympathetic
harmony. Her face is inclined to be
sad in repose, but lights quickly and effectively
to the soul of whatever subject she
touches. Her voice is singularly clear and
free from harsh notes. She exhibits no apparent
effort in speaking, and at once impresses
an audience by her ease, her courage,
and her self-abnegation. Through all her
work moreover constantly thrills her great
hope for the young men and women of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
race, so many of whom she has personally
inspired.</p>

<p>Such a woman is an asset to her country
and an honor to the race to which she belongs.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
